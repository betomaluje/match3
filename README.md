# Match 3 programming assignment

It's really awesome of you to apply for a position at Resolution Games!

As part of the evaluation process, we let candidates make a small game in Unity.

Please read the following instructions and have a look at the project.
Then get back to me (Martin) about when you estimate you can submit the result.
(This means you choose your own deadline.)
Then hack away! :-)

## Instructions

Make a simple Match 3 game based on this Unity project.

The game mechanics are as follows:

  * The game consists of m x n tiles (configurable).

  * If more than three of the same tile type are in a horizontal row, they are removed.

  * A tile falls down if there is no tile below it (unless it's on the bottom row).

  * The user can click on a tile. The tile is then removed.

Make it simple, but write the code to a quality that's good enough for professional developers to continue working on.
As a performance guideline for the code, design it so it runs well on relatively limited devices such as mobiles.

See [the movie](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwkg9csM9h-BWVhsOWxWM0JMUFU/view?usp=sharing)
to get an idea of what it can look like.
Feel free to make it more spectacular as long as the basic gameplay is there.

Follow Resolution's [Style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/125PpjQRCybOSFyk-ecJC3PgkHHkn5wflN3XIuIVpAV4/edit).

## Submission

Clone the project from this repository.
Do not create a public repository!

Work with Git locally as usual. Do not push, as you have no write permissions.

Make sure you have committed the final version.

Then create a zip file of the .git directory.

Send the zip file to Martin. You should have my e-mail address already. :-)
